                    <p>In this episode we join Bowie and DJ in one of the most infamous moments of their childhoods. The yearly Boy Scouts camping trip, where the young Bowie follows his brother to experience and explore the wonders of nature. In this episode formative moments impact the two brothers, such as their experiences watching one of the more sadistic camp members roast crickets over the fire. Neither of the boys liked that one!</p>
                    <p>We also begin to see a presence of prowess and ability shown in DJ that is lacking in Bowie. It seems, physically Bowie is quite a bit weaker and can’t manage to keep up. Hikes seem more difficult for Bowie, and he just never quite seems to win at basketball. </p>

                        Bowie was pretty bad at Little League and struck out looking at the last game of his season. DJ and Grandpa were able to bond over baseball; Bowie was left to his own devices. </p>

“Oh you’re DJ’s brother !” is the common phrase of this era. A lot of the time Bowie leans into this, but it can still feel diminishing. However, here is where Bowie took steps to leave his brother’s shadow. He developed his own community of friends, instead of relying on asking to hang out with DJ’s cool friends. We meet lasting best friends, a handful of girlfriends and some enemies. But sometimes, Bowie can’t escape the shadow. It seems as though every experience Bowie has isn’t novel and is simply history repeating itself.

                    <p>College was a different beast for Bowie. Everything felt new, and yet he could still feel the mark DJ left. The first semester he was there, DJ was finishing up graduating. We see them take a class together: HISTART 271: Bowie is able to beat DJ in every single essay which feels really good. But still, the semester is fun. DJ seems to crash at Bowie’s dorm every other weekend, and going to the same school as your brother for the first and last time since kindergarten is exciting. </p>
                    <p>Bowie begins to see DJ’s weaknesses, and begins to acknowledge the strengths both brothers bring. They take a trip together to the Philippines in the series finale, debuting next week!</p>

                           Really enjoyed these two in my class. I know they absolutely loved learning about Courbet and Cezanne and how their art impacted French culture. 1800's France is fascinating!

                    <p>In classic fashion, the two boys travel to Southeast Asia in search of cheap beer and good times. It’s here that Bowie is able to finally confront DJ about his emotions. The feeling of never being out of the shadow. DJ responds simply, “you’re your own person.” </p>
                    <p>Find out how Bowie reacts in this series finale! Spoiler alert: We see a moment of acceptance! It seems a path has been paved for Bowie, but he is still able to create his own trails. Together, the two work in junction to make a mark on anywhere they go, and people will hear the names Bowie and DJ for sometime. </p>
